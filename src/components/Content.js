        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>Some of my personal passions and priorities include advocacy, reducing environmental impact, and protecting human rights. My dream job would be for a company that values inclusivity and diversity in their hiring practices, and allows me use my development skills in a collaborative team setting that reflects those same passions and priorities. When I'm not working on projects, I love getting outdoors in the great Pacific Northwest, vegan pizza, and hanging out with my dog.</p>
